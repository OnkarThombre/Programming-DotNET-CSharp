Here is your **SHORT, POWERFUL & INTERVIEW-READY CHEAT SHEET** for

### ✅ ViewBag vs ViewData vs TempData (ASP.NET MVC / ASP.NET Core)

ViewData => Dictionary (`ViewDataDictionary`)
ViewBag => Dynamic Object
TempData => Dictionary 

used to send data from controller to view 
> ViewBag and ViewData are used to pass data from controller to view for a single request, while TempData is used to persist data across requests mainly during redirects.(return RedirectToAction()) here TempData is used .
---

# 🔹 Core Purpose

All three are used to **pass data from Controller to View**.

## ✅ Comparison Table (Must-remember)

| Feature            | ViewData                          | ViewBag              | TempData                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Type               | Dictionary (`ViewDataDictionary`) | Dynamic Object       | Dictionary                       |
| Type Safety        | ❌ No                              | ❌ No                 | ❌ No                             |
| Lifetime           | Current Request Only              | Current Request Only | Across Requests                  |
| Scope              | Controller → View                 | Controller → View    | Controller → View → Next Request |
| Persistence        | Not stored                        | Not stored           | Stored in Session                |
| Needs Type Casting | ✅ Yes                             | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                            |
| Redirect Support   | ❌ No                              | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                            |

## ✅ ViewData

```csharp
ViewData["Name"] = "Onkar";
```

In View:

```cshtml
@ViewData["Name"]
```

* Uses key-value pair
* Requires casting for complex objects
* Works only for same request

---

## ✅ ViewBag

```csharp
ViewBag.Name = "Onkar";
```

In View:

```cshtml
@ViewBag.Name
```

* Wrapper over ViewData
* Uses dynamic
* Cleaner syntax

---

## ✅ TempData

```csharp
TempData["Message"] = "Saved Successfully";
```

In View:

```cshtml
@TempData["Message"]
```

* Persists across redirect
* Uses Session internally
* Best for success/error messages

---

# 🔥 Real Usage Example

### Controller

```csharp
public IActionResult Demo()
{
    ViewData["A"] = "From ViewData";
    ViewBag.B = "From ViewBag";
    TempData["C"] = "From TempData";

    return RedirectToAction("Result");
}
```

### Result Action

```csharp
public IActionResult Result()
{
    return View();
}
```

### View (Result.cshtml)

```html
<p>@ViewData["A"]</p>   <!-- ❌ null -->
<p>@ViewBag.B</p>       <!-- ❌ null -->
<p>@TempData["C"]</p>   <!-- ✅ works -->
```

# ✅ Detailed Behaviour

| Scenario          | ViewData | ViewBag | TempData |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Same View         | ✅        | ✅       | ✅        |
| RedirectToAction  | ❌        | ❌       | ✅        |
| Multiple Requests | ❌        | ❌       | ✅ (once) |

---

# 🧠 Memory Trick

```
ViewData & ViewBag → 1 request
TempData → 2 requests
```

---

# ✅ When to Use What?

| Situation                    | Best Choice           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Pass small data to same view | ViewBag               |
| Pass data after Redirect     | TempData              |
| Strong typing                | Model (Best Practice) |

# ⚡ Interview One-liner

> ViewBag and ViewData are used to pass data from controller to view for a single request, while TempData is used to persist data across requests mainly during redirects.

---

# ✅ Key Notes

* Prefer Model over all 3
* TempData is auto-cleared after read
* ViewBag internally uses ViewData

---







Sure 👍 Let’s start **from absolute scratch** and build your understanding clearly.

---

# 🧠 First: Why do ViewBag, ViewData, TempData exist?

In ASP.NET MVC / ASP.NET Core:

* Controller processes data
* View displays data

So we need a way to **send data from Controller → View**.
That’s where these three come in.

---

# ✅ 1. ViewData – The Base Concept

### What is ViewData?

ViewData is a dictionary used to pass data from controller to view.

### Syntax:

Controller:

```csharp
ViewData["Name"] = "Onkar";
```

View:

```cshtml
@ViewData["Name"]
```

### Characteristics:

* Key-value pair
* Exists only for CURRENT request
* Requires type casting for complex types

### Think of it as:

A bag of data that disappears once the page loads.

---

# ✅ 2. ViewBag – Friendly Version of ViewData

### What is ViewBag?

ViewBag is a dynamic wrapper over ViewData.

### Syntax:

Controller:

```csharp
ViewBag.Name = "Onkar";
```

View:

```cshtml
@ViewBag.Name
```

### Characteristics:

* No need for key string
* Same lifetime as ViewData
* Cleaner and readable
* Still not type-safe

### Internally:

```
ViewBag → ViewData
```

So ViewBag is just syntactic sugar.

---

# ✅ 3. TempData – Data Across Requests

### What is TempData?

TempData is used when you want data available even AFTER redirect.

### Syntax:

Controller:

```csharp
TempData["msg"] = "Saved Successfully";
return RedirectToAction("Index");
```

View:

```cshtml
@TempData["msg"]
```

### Characteristics:

* Survives redirect
* Uses Session internally
* Data removed after one read

Used mainly for:
✔ Success messages
✔ Error alerts
✔ Notifications

# 🔥 Core Differences at a Glance

| Feature          | ViewData        | ViewBag         | TempData     |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Type             | Dictionary      | Dynamic Object  | Dictionary   |
| Lifetime         | Current Request | Current Request | Next Request |
| Redirect Support | ❌ No            | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes        |
| Storage          | Server Memory   | Server Memory   | Session      |
| Type Safety      | ❌ No            | ❌ No            | ❌ No         |

---

# ✅ Practical Example

### Controller

```csharp
public IActionResult Save()
{
    ViewData["A"] = "Hello ViewData";
    ViewBag.B = "Hello ViewBag";
    TempData["C"] = "Hello TempData";

    return RedirectToAction("Result");
}
```

### Result View

```cshtml
<p>@ViewData["A"]</p>   <!-- null -->
<p>@ViewBag.B</p>       <!-- null -->
<p>@TempData["C"]</p>   <!-- Hello TempData -->
```

---

# 🎯 Real-life analogy

* ViewData = Message written on whiteboard (erased after class)
* ViewBag = Sticky note (also removed after use)
* TempData = Message saved in diary for next day

---

# ✅ When to Use

| Situation           | Recommended         |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Same request data   | ViewBag or ViewData |
| Post-Redirect-Get   | TempData            |
| Strong data passing | Model (Best)        |

---

# ✅ Interview-ready Summary

> ViewData and ViewBag are used to pass data from controller to view within the same request, but TempData preserves data across redirects using session, making it useful for one-time messages.

---

# ✅ Quick Memory Trick

```
Same request → ViewBag / ViewData  
Next request → TempData
```
