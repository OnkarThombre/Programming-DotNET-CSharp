Great 👍
Let’s move to the **next topic in deep interview style**:

# ✅ PART 2: PARTIAL METHOD IN C# (Complete + Interview Focused)

---

## 🔷 What is a Partial Method?

### Interview Definition:

> A partial method is a method declared in one part of a partial class and optionally implemented in another part of the same partial class. If not implemented, the compiler removes it completely.

So it is:

* Declared in one file
* Implemented in another file
* Optional to implement

---

## ✅ Why Partial Method Exists

Partial methods were designed mainly for:

* **Auto-generated code scenarios**
* Allow developer hooks without modifying generated code
* Performance optimization (compiler removes unused method)

---

## ✅ Basic Syntax

### Declaration (File 1)

```csharp
public partial class Student
{
    partial void OnCreated();
}
```

### Implementation (File 2)

```csharp
public partial class Student
{
    partial void OnCreated()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Student created");
    }
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
Student s = new Student();
```

---

## 🔥 What happens if method is NOT implemented?

```csharp
public partial class Student
{
    partial void OnCreated();
}
```

If no implementation exists:

* ✅ No compile error
* ✅ All calls to it are removed
* ✅ Zero performance cost

This is the key feature.

---

## ✅ Real Example (Most Practical)

```csharp
// File 1 - Auto generated
public partial class Employee
{
    public void Create()
    {
        OnBeforeCreate();
        Console.WriteLine("Employee Created");
    }

    partial void OnBeforeCreate();
}
```

```csharp
// File 2 - Developer logic
public partial class Employee
{
    partial void OnBeforeCreate()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Custom logic before creation");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Custom logic before creation
Employee Created
```

If developer removes method → only "Employee Created" prints.

## ✅ Rules of Partial Method (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Rule                              | Explanation                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Must be inside partial class      | ✅ Yes                            |
| Return type                       | void only                        |
| Access modifier                   | Not allowed (implicitly private) |
| Can have parameters               | ✅ Yes                            |
| Can have out/ref parameters       | ✅ Yes                            |
| Can have virtual/override         | ❌ No                             |
| Must be implemented in same class | ✅ Yes                            |

---

## ❌ INVALID Partial Method Examples

```csharp
public partial class Test
{
    public partial int Show(); // ❌ Invalid (must be void)
}
```

```csharp
public partial class Test
{
    protected partial void Log(); // ❌ Invalid (no access modifier)
}
```

---

## ✅ Relationship with Partial Class

Partial method can ONLY exist in a partial class.

```csharp
public class Test
{
    partial void Demo();  // ❌ Error
}
```

Must be:

```csharp
public partial class Test
{
    partial void Demo();  // ✅ Valid
}
```

---

## ✅ Partial Method Use Cases

1. Before saving data
2. Before deleting records
3. Hook for developer customization
4. Extension points for generated code

---

## 🔥 Interview Differences: Partial Method vs Normal Method

| Feature                 | Partial Method | Normal Method |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Implementation required | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes         |
| Can have return type    | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes         |
| Access modifier         | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes         |
| Removed if unused       | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No          |

---

## ✅ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: What happens if partial method is not implemented?

> The method and its calls are removed at compile time without any error.

### Q: Why is return type void?

> Because compiler must safely remove the call without affecting program flow.

---

## ✅ Diagram (Conceptual Flow)

```
Generated File
   ↓ declares partial method
Developer File
   ↓ optionally implements
Compiler
   ↓ merges & optimizes
```

---

## ✅ Mini Interview Example

```csharp
public partial class Logger
{
    public void Process()
    {
        OnLog();
        Console.WriteLine("Processing");
    }

    partial void OnLog();
}
```

If implemented:

```
OnLog executed then Processing
```

If not:

```
Only Processing
```

# 🎯 Interview-Ready Summary

> A partial method is a method declared in a partial class whose implementation is optional. If the implementation is not provided, the compiler removes the method and its calls completely, making it useful for extension points in auto-generated code.

---

## ✅ One-liner for Interview

"Partial method allows optional implementation of a method in partial classes and is mainly used to provide hooks for generated code."
