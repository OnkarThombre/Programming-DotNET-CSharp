Perfect 👍
We’ll go **one by one in interview style**, starting with the most important:

---

# ✅ PART 1: PARTIAL CLASS IN C# (Full Interview Explanation)

---

## 🔷 What is a Partial Class?

### Interview Definition:

> A partial class in C# allows a single class to be split across multiple files, but during compilation, all parts are combined into one class.

Simply:

* You write the same class in different files
* Compiler merges them into one

---

## ✅ Syntax

Each file uses the `partial` keyword.

### File 1: Student.Part1.cs

```csharp
public partial class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

### File 2: Student.Part2.cs

```csharp
public partial class Student
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Id} - {Name}");
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```csharp
Student s = new Student();
s.Id = 1;
s.Name = "Onkar";
s.Display();
```

✅ Internally this becomes:

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public void Display() { ... }
}
```

## 🔥 Why Partial Class is Used

### 1. Separation of generated code and manual code

Entity Framework or Designer-generated code is kept safe.

### 2. Large class management

Huge files are split into logical parts.

### 3. Team collaboration

Multiple developers can work on the same class without conflict.

---

## ✅ Real-world Example (EF / ASP.NET)

```text
Student.cs          → Auto generated
Student.Custom.cs   → Developer code
```

Both combined = `Student` class

---

## ✅ Rules of Partial Class (IMPORTANT)

All partial parts must:

1. Have same name
2. Be in same namespace
3. Have same access modifier
4. Can be in different files
5. Can contain different members

### ❌ Invalid Example

```csharp
public partial class Student {}
private partial class Student {}   // ERROR: different access modifier
```

---

## ✅ Can Partial Class Have Constructor?

YES ✅

```csharp
public partial class Student
{
    public Student()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Constructor called");
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Can Partial Class Have Inheritance?

YES ✅ (but only one part defines base class)

```csharp
public partial class Student : Person
{
}
```

---

## ✅ Partial vs Normal Class

| Feature                   | Normal Class | Partial Class |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Split into multiple files | ❌            | ✅             |
| Single identity           | ✅            | ✅             |
| Used in big projects      | ❌            | ✅             |

---

## ✅ Common Interview Questions

### Q1. Why do we use partial class?

> To split a large class into multiple files for better organization and maintainability.

### Q2. Where is it mostly used?

> Commonly used with Entity Framework and auto-generated designer files.

### Q3. Can methods be in different files?

> Yes, they are merged into one class at compile time.

---

## ✅ Advantages

✔ Better readability
✔ Easy maintenance
✔ Safe auto-code regeneration
✔ Cleaner architecture

---

## ❌ Limitations

* Cannot have different base classes
* Must follow strict rules
* Overuse can reduce readability

---

## ✅ Practical Mini Example

```csharp
// File A
public partial class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// File B
public partial class Calculator
{
    public int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
Calculator c = new Calculator();
Console.WriteLine(c.Add(2,3));
Console.WriteLine(c.Multiply(2,3));
```

# 🎯 Interview Ready Summary

> A partial class allows a single class to be defined across multiple files. All parts are combined at compile time into one logical class. It is mainly used to separate auto-generated and developer-written code and improve code organization.

---

## ✅ Quick One-Liner (Interviews)

"A partial class helps split a big class into smaller logical files while maintaining a single class identity."

### NEXT STEP 👉

We’ll go deeper in this order:

1️⃣ ✅ Partial Class ✅ (Done)
2️⃣ Partial Method (next)
3️⃣ Partial Interface
4️⃣ Partial Struct
5️⃣ Partial vs Inheritance vs Extension Methods

👉 Say **"Next: Partial Method"** and we’ll continue in the same deep interview style.
