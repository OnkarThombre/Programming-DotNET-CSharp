Here is a **clear, complete and interview-ready explanation of Delegates in C#** ✅

---

# ✅ What is a Delegate in C#?

### Simple Definition:

> A delegate is a type-safe function pointer that holds a reference to a method and allows methods to be passed as parameters.

In short:

* Delegate = Reference to method
* Enables callback mechanism
* Supports event-driven programming

---

# 🔹 Why Delegates are Needed

* To achieve loose coupling
* To implement events
* To pass methods as parameters
* To execute methods dynamically

---

# ✅ Basic Delegate Example

```csharp
// Step 1: Delegate declaration
public delegate void MyDelegate(string msg);

// Step 2: Method matching delegate signature
public class Test
{
    public static void Show(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

// Step 3: Using delegate
MyDelegate del = Test.Show;
del("Hello Delegate");
```

Output:

```
Hello Delegate
```

# ✅ Types of Delegates in C#

There are **3 main types** 👇

---

## 1️⃣ Single-cast Delegate

Points to ONE method.

```csharp
delegate void MyDelegate();

class Demo
{
    static void A() => Console.WriteLine("Method A");

    static void Main()
    {
        MyDelegate d = A;
        d();   // Calls A only
    }
}
```

---

## 2️⃣ Multicast Delegate

Points to MULTIPLE methods.

```csharp
delegate void MyDelegate();

class Demo
{
    static void A() => Console.WriteLine("A");
    static void B() => Console.WriteLine("B");

    static void Main()
    {
        MyDelegate d = A;
        d += B;
        d();   // Calls A then B
    }
}
```

---

## 3️⃣ Generic Delegates (Built-in)

C# provides ready-made delegates:

### ✅ Action

* No return value

```csharp
Action<string> print = msg => Console.WriteLine(msg);
print("Hello");
```

### ✅ Func

* Returns a value

```csharp
Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;
Console.WriteLine(add(5, 3));
```

### ✅ Predicate

* Returns bool

```csharp
Predicate<int> isEven = x => x % 2 == 0;
Console.WriteLine(isEven(4));  // true
```

# 🔥 Delegates vs Methods

| Feature               | Delegate | Method |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Can be assigned       | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No   |
| Supports multicasting | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No   |
| Callable later        | ✅ Yes    | ✅ Yes  |
| Pass as parameter     | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No   |

---

# ✅ Delegate & Event Relationship

Delegates are the backbone of Events:

```csharp
public event Action OnClick;
```

# ✅ Interview Cheat Sheet

| Type        | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Single-cast | One method              |
| Multicast   | Multiple methods        |
| Generic     | Action, Func, Predicate |

# 🎯 Interview Ready Definition

> A delegate in C# is a type-safe reference to a method that allows methods to be passed as parameters and supports callback functionality.

---

# ✅ Common Interview Questions

### Q1. What is delegate?

Reference type that points to a method.

### Q2. Multicast delegate?

Delegate that can hold multiple method references.

### Q3. Difference between Action & Func?

Action returns void, Func returns value.

---

# ✅ Simple Analogy

Delegate is like a remote control.
You press it — it executes the assigned method.
